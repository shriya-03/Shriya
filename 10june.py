#b. If the character is ')':We pop the top of the stack. After popping:
#If the stack is empty, it means we donâ€™t have a matching '(' for this ')', so:
#We push the current index as a new "base" (like -1 before).
#This helps reset the base for future valid substrings.
#If the stack is not empty, we found a valid substring:
