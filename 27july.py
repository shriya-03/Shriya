# subscription: the initial cost of the subscription.
# game_price: the price of a single game if bought individually.
# first_discount: the discount factor for the first game with the subscription (e.g., 0.75 means 25% off).
# perc: the percentage (factor) by which each subsequent game gets cheaper under the subscription.
